CFG Homework: It is vital to learn how to use GitHub.
A repository is usually used to organise a single project. 
Repositories can contain folders adn files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets - anything your project needs. 
We recommend inculding a README, or a file wiht information about your project. 
GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your repository. 
Is also offers other common options such as a license file.

saved changes are called commits
each commit has an associated commit message - which is a description explaining why a particular change was made
